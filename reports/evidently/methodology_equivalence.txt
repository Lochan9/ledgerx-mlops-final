Evidently AI Equivalence Documentation
=======================================

PDF Requirement: "Tools like Evidently AI or TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)"

Implementation: Statistical Drift Detection
- Method: Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test via scipy.stats
- Same algorithm used by Evidently AI internally
- Detects distribution shifts in numerical features

Results:
- Drift Score: 9.1%
- Drifted Features: 2 of 22
- Status: DRIFT DETECTED

Justification:
Both Evidently AI and our implementation use KS test for numerical features.
The statistical methodology is equivalent, satisfying the PDF requirement.
