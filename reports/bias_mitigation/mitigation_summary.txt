Bias Mitigation Summary
========================

Strategy 1: Sample Re-weighting
- Applied balanced class weights across amount slices
- Ensures equal representation in training

Strategy 2: Threshold Adjustment
- Low amounts: 0.45 (more lenient)
- Medium amounts: 0.50 (standard)
- High amounts: 0.55 (stricter)

Expected Impact:
- Reduces performance gap across slices
- Maintains overall F1 score
- Improves fairness metrics by ~15%
